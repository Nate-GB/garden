This can leave a large gap in your recovery methods. However, there is a way around this. Enter,\n\n# Snapshots\n\nSnapshots are similar to backups, but rather than focusing on files they essentially take a \"picture\" of an file system.  Backup programs are then able to restore from these snapshots. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of data maintained by the file system. Snapshots are provided by the Volume Shadow Copy Service on NTFS volumes. \n\nSnapshots can also be made of [[Virtual Machines]].\n\n# Images\n\nImages are like snapshots, but for entire systems. An image backup duplicates an OS installation. It's like flash-freezing a cave man; once you thaw him out, it's like no time has passed at all.  \n\n\n# Backup Storage\n\nBackups need to be stored as securely as live data, so it's essentially the same data tucked away for emergencies.  If the origin data is highly confidential and has a high integrity requirement, then so must the backup data.  Availability is a little bit different, but is still something that must be carefully considered.  \n\nTo prepare for large-scale events that could threaten both the live data and the backup, it's usually good practice to keep some of your backups offsite.  This can enable a faster recovery time in the event of a natural disaster, for example. However, you must ensure you are either able to support the bandwidth needed to transmit the data or a reliable way to move physical copies to your offsite storage for it to be an effective method of storage. \n\nYou also need to consider online storage vs offline storage.  To do so, you need to evaluate the balance between availability and security that is acceptable to you. This will obviously differ for each company and even each person, so find the balance that's right for your purposes. Offline storage is not as easily accessible in the event of an emergency, but it is considerably more secure. Online storage is almost immediately accessible, but at the cost of increased risk of security incidents. \n\nA general rule of thumb that's widely accepted in backup storage is called the [[3-2-1 Rule]]. \n\n# Backup Media Types\n\nThere are several different types of media available to store your backups on. Here's a few:\n\n- Disk\n\t- Removeable hard drives\n\t- Low Cost option\n\t- Not a large enough capacity for enterprise backup solutions\n- Network Attached Storage\n\t- Usually utilizes a RAID storage protocol\n\t- Available over common network protocols\n\t- File-level backups\n\t- No offsite option\n- Tape\n\t- Very cost effective\n\t- Easily transported offsite\n\t- High storage capability\n\t- Slow compared to disk-based solutions\n- Storage Area Network (SAN) and Cloud\n\t- Block-level addressing\n\t- can use multiple RAID arrays\n\t- Can achieve offsite storage through replication\n\n\n# Restoration\n\nIn the event of an outage or incident, there is a specific order that services and systems should be brought back online and verified.  This is referred to as the [[Order of Restoration]]. If systems are brought back online in an uncontrolled way, there is serious risk of causing additional power problems or of causing problems in the network, OS, or application layers due to dependencies between these.

There are 6 principal stages in an incident response lifecycle.\n\n1. Preparation\n\t1. Make the system resilient to attack in the first place. This includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and setting up confidential lines of communication. It also implies creating incident response resources and procedures\n2. Identification\n\t1. From the information in an alert or report, determine whether and incident has taken place, assess how sever it might be, and notify stakeholders\n3. Containment\n\t1. Limit the scope and magnitude of the incident. The goal of incident response is to secure data while limiting the immediate impact on customers and business partners\n4. Eradication\n\t1. Remove the cause and restore the affected system to a secure state by wiping a system and applying secure config settings\n5. Recovery\n\t1. The system can now be reintegrated.  Applying patches and updates toa  system to help prevent future incidents is important as well. This phase may involve restoration of data from backup and security testing.  Systems must be monitored more closely for a period to detect and prevent any reoccurrence of the attack. The response process may gave to iterate through multiple phases of identification, containment, eradication, and recovery to effect a complete resolution.\n6. Lessons Learned\n\t1. Analyze the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident. The outputs from this phase feed back into a new preparation phase in the cycle.\n\n\n![Incident Response Lifecycle](notes/images/Incident%20Repsonse%20Lifecycle.jpg)","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T20:04:37.310798336Z","tags":null},"/notes/Incremental-Backups":{"title":"Incremental Backups","content":"\nA type of backup where only files modified since the last backup and new files are backed up.\n\n![Incremental Backup](notes/images/increment-backup.jpg)","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T20:04:37.310798336Z","tags":null},"/notes/Information-Life-Cycle-Management":{"title":"Information Life Cycle Management","content":"\n# The information life cycle model\n- Creation/collection\n\t- data may be generated by an employee or automated system, or it may be submitted by a customer or supplier.
