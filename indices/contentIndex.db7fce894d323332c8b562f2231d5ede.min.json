Some people refer to this as a \"second brain,\" but I barely have a firm grasp on my own meat-brain so I'd much rather think of this like a collection or reference database than have a whole other brain to worry about.\n\nIdeally I'll keep this updated and current as I cram more knowledge and information into my head, but we all know this is going to end up as sporadic bursts of info-dumping. The ultimate goal is to try to connect different pieces of knowledge and deepen my understanding of more complex topics.\n\nThis whole thing is powered by [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/) so shout out to Jacky Zhao. If you want to  earn more about that, check out Jacky's own [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz).\n\n# How to navigate\n\n[[tags/seed/|Seeds]] are low-level concepts, ie something that is taken straight from a resource. These are like basic notes and serve as a growing point. More complex ideas will spring from them.\n\n[[tags/sapling/|Saplings]] are extensions of seeds. They're deeper knowledge, going into the nitty gritty for concepts laid out by seeds. Not every seed will have a sapling, and not every sapling comes from a seed. Sometimes multiple saplings come from one seed. You just never know\n\n[[tags/fruit/|Fruit]] are the long-form learning moments.  Fruit are the resulting connections and knowledge gained from the information laid out by seeds and saplings. These are usually essay-esque. \n\nA good way to think about the three categories is that seeds are data, saplings are information, and fruit is knowledge.  \n\nWith all that out of the way, let's get growing!\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T21:26:06.059044643Z","tags":null},"/notes/Community-Cloud":{"title":"Community Cloud","content":"\nCommunity clouds are a type of cloud computing  where the cloud is available to be used by a community.
