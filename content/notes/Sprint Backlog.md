The [Scrum Team](notes/Scrum%20Team.md)'s plan for the upcoming sprint. It includes what the team will do, why they think it is important, and how they will get it done. The team creates a [sprint goal](Sprint%20Goal) to describe the single objective that the team plans to meet to advance toward the [Product Goal](notes/Product%20Goal.md), just as the product goal summarizes the value of the product backlog, the sprint goal summarizes the value of the sprint. It helps the team stay focused.
