An ordered list of product changes or enhancements. The [Product Owner](notes/Product%20Owner.md) owns and manages the backlog. However, the [Scrum Team](notes/Scrum%20Team.md) helps refine the top product backlog items so that they can begin to implement them. The product owner uses a [product goal](notes/Product%20Goal) to describe the product's longer-term target, and the product backlog should deliver the product goal.
