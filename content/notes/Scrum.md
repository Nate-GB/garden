A lightweight, customer-centric framework. Arguably the most common [Agile Approach](notes/Agile%20Approach.md) framework.

- All or nothing framework: you use every part of scrum or it isn't scrum

## 5 Scrum values describe how people should approach each other
- Commitment
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage

## 3 Scrum Pillars represent how teams should treat the work
- Transparency
- Inspections
- Adaptation

## The 4 steps of Scrum are:
- Product owner prioritizes work into a [product backlog](notes/Product%20Backlog)
- Scrum team selects the top items in the backlog. The top items create a [sprint backlog](notes/Sprint%20Backlog), which will deliver a working product that helps solve the top problem in the product backlog
- Scrum team and [Stakeholders](notes/Stakeholders.md) review the sprint results and adapt the product and the team's approach for the next sprint
- The steps repeat as long as the product backlog exists

## Scrum Roles
- [Scrum Team](notes/Scrum%20Team)
- [Product Owner](notes/Product%20Owner)
- [Scrum Master](notes/Scrum%20Master)
- [Developers](notes/Developers)

## Scrum Events
- [Increment](notes/Increment)
- [Sprint](notes/Sprint)
	- Sprint Planning
		- The [Product Owner](notes/Product%20Owner.md) discusses the highest-priority items in the [Product Backlog](notes/Product%20Backlog.md) and how they erlate to the [Product Goal](notes/Product%20Goal.md). The team creates a [Sprint Backlog](notes/Sprint%20Backlog.md) by breaking down Product Backlog Items (PBIs) into smaller pieces of work.  The team is wholly responsible for deciding how to deliver work. Usually lasts eight hours for one-month sprints and less for shorter sprints.
	- Daily Scrum
		- [Developers](notes/Developers.md) meet to review progress toward the [Sprint Goal](notes/Sprint%20Goal.md) and plan the next 24 hours of work. Developers should self-organize and sue this time to create plans, review issues, and make decisions. The daily scrum lasts for 15 minutes every working day.
	- Sprint Review
		- The [Agile](notes/Agile%20Approach.md) team shares their progress with [Stakeholders](notes/Stakeholders.md). Demonstrating small pieces of work reveals valuable information. It uncovers issues early when they are small and easy to fix, reveals previously unknown development ideas, or confirms that the team is on track. Typically, the group shares their progress and the stakeholders provide feedback and ask questions. All attendees discuss where to go next, and the [Product Owner](notes/Product%20Owner.md) may adjust the [Product Backlog](notes/Product%20Backlog.md) based on the sprint review. A sprint review lasts four hours for one-month sprints and less for shorter sprints.
	- Sprint Retrospective
		- the team inspects how they worked in the past sprint and identifies improvement opportunities.  The retrospective is the only event that isn't concentrated on the product. Instead, the retrospective focuses on the [Scrum Team](notes/Scrum%20Team.md) and how they work together. The event lasts three hours for one-month sprints and less for shorter sprints.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

- Strengths
	- Lightweight framework
	- Flexible
	- Responsive learning
	- Complex Problem Solving
	- Less time between planning and the first finished product
	- Good pacing and task breakdown
	- Continuous improvement and adaptation
- Weaknesses
	- Depends on precise circumstances
	- Relies on the organization to respect the product owner's decisions about the backlog and priorities
	- Designed for a single, high-performing and cross-functional team, so less experienced teams could struggle
	- Hard to scale to large groups
	- Lost of meetings
