# What is a digital garden?

This digital garden is a place to collect and organize my thoughts. Some people refer to this as a "second brain," but I barely have a firm grasp on my own meat-brain so I'd much rather think of this like a collection or reference database than have a whole other brain to worry about.

Ideally I'll keep this updated and current as I cram more knowledge and information into my head, but we all know this is going to end up as sporadic bursts of info-dumping. The ultimate goal is to try to connect different pieces of knowledge and deepen my understanding of more complex topics.

This whole thing is powered by [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/) so shout out to Jacky Zhao. If you want to  earn more about that, check out Jacky's own [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz).

In the meantime, let's get growing!
