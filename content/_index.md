# What is a digital garden?

This digital garden is a place to collect and organize my thoughts. Some people refer to this as a "second brain," but I barely have a firm grasp on my own meat-brain so I'd much rather think of this like a collection or reference database than have a whole other brain to worry about.

Ideally I'll keep this updated and current as I cram more knowledge and information into my head, but we all know this is going to end up as sporadic bursts of info-dumping. The ultimate goal is to try to connect different pieces of knowledge and deepen my understanding of more complex topics.

This whole thing is powered by [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/) so shout out to Jacky Zhao. If you want to  earn more about that, check out Jacky's own [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz).

# How to navigate

[[tags/seed/_index.md|Seeds]] are low-level concepts, ie something that is taken straight from a resource. These are like basic notes and serve as a growing point. More complex ideas will spring from them.

[[tags/sapling/_index.md|Saplings]] are extensions of seeds. They're deeper knowledge, going into the nitty gritty for concepts laid out by seeds. Not every seed will have a sapling, and not every sapling comes from a seed. Sometimes multiple saplings come from one seed. You just never know

[[tags/fruit/_index.md|Fruit]] are the long-form learning moments.  Fruit are the resulting connections and knowledge gained from the information laid out by seeds and saplings. These are usually essay-esque. 

A good way to think about the three categories is that seeds are data, saplings are information, and fruit is knowledge.  

With all that out of the way, let's get growing!
